                    <p class='description'>The goal of this website is <b>not</b> to firmly conclude why bus ridership is decreasing, but to present Washington, DC specific data in an easily digestible manner on factors widely regarded as possible reasons this is happening.</p> <p class='description'>The hope is that you, the reader, can take in this information and derive your own theories while reflecting on whether these are trends you have observed in your community over the same period.</p> <p class='description'> <i>Over the next two infographics, you may hover your mouse over any bar (excluding "Traffic") to derive the actual figures for that year.</i></p><h3>Enjoy!</h3>

                    <h3>Population</h3>
                    <p class='description'><i>Perhaps population has decreased?</i></p>
                    <p class='description'>Nope, but that is a good guess! If population is dwindling, it would make sense that fewer people would be around to fill the buses. However, population in DC has steadily risen since 2006 and Mayor Muriel Bowser is excited about the District potentially topping <a class="p-a" href="https://dc.gov/release/washington-dc-population-closing-700000" target="_blank">700,000</a> residents in 2018.</p>

                    <h3>Automobile Registration</h3>
                    <p class='description'><i>Have Washingtonians decided to buy a car and drive themselves?</i></p>
                    <p class='description'>Perhaps... Since 2014, the percentage growth of automobile registrations has outpaced population change. However, one could make the argument that this is due in part to the negative trend in <a class="p-a" href="https://www.eia.gov/opendata/qb.php?sdid=PET.EMM_EPM0_PTE_R1Y_DPG.A" target="_blank">gas prices</a> in the Central Atlantic region (and the U.S. in general) over this same period of time.</p>

                    <h3>Traffic</h3>
                    <p class='description'><i>The number of cars on the road is outpacing population, surely this must be reflected in the traffic counts?</i></p>
                    <p class='description'>Unlike population and automobile registrations, traffic has seen some subtle inconsistencies over the years*. There were percentage decreases in 2011 and 2015, but perhaps the most interesting thing here is the roughly 2.5% increase throughout 2016, right around the same time bus ridership started its significant downward trend...</p>

                    <h3>Bus Ridership</h3>
                    <p class='description'>The <i>outlier</i> of the group.</p>
                    <p class='description'>None of the other previous variables saw percentage increases over 3% or fell more than 1.5%. Meanwhile, bus ridership spiked in 2011 with a 6% growth and only six years later saw a 6% dip (on top of two straight years of 4% stumbles).</p>
                    <br><br><br><br><br><br>
                    <p class='description'>Considering none of these mirrors the bus ridership trend, it would be difficult for one to conclude that any one of these factors <i>solely</i> impacted bus ridership. If traffic was not getting any better or worse while population and car ownership were increasing, how exactly were people getting around town?</p>

                <h3>Alternative Means of Commuting</h3>
                <p class='description'>The means of transportation that residents used to commute to and from work between 2011-2016 has stayed quite consistent, but there is a pattern of change developing! We saw there are more cars in DC, but those driving alone and carpooling have actually seen slight percentage decreases, which may be due to the fact that DC is consistently among the cities with the <a class="p-a" href="https://wtop.com/local/2018/02/much-time-d-c-area-drivers-spend-stuck-congested-traffic/" target="_blank">worst traffic</a> (cars can be convenient, but crawling along the Beltway is a surefire way to kill your caffeine buzz).</p>
                <p class='description'><i>How are they getting to work now?</i> Public transportation saw growth from 2011-2013, but has been decreasing ever since...</p>
                <p class='description'>We are now left with three categories that have seen steady increases: walkers, "other", and those that work from home. With technological advances granting more workers the ability to work remotely (myself included) and the numerous development projects of DC reaching their <a class="p-a" href="https://www.bizjournals.com/washington/news/2017/12/14/good-bad-ugly-d-c-economic-development-by-the.html" target="_blank">relative peak</a>, it makes sense that more people would live nearer to their offices or stay home all together.</p>
                <p class='description'>"Other" includes bikers (with <i>and</i> without motors) and those that hail a ride the old fashioned way or through their mobile devices. Thanks to <a class="p-a" href="http://godcgo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/goDCgo_bike_factsheet_052918.pdf" target="_blank">options</a>, cyclists have pedaled DC into the <a class="p-a" href="https://www.citylab.com/transportation/2017/12/how-washington-dc-built-a-bike-boom/548903/" target="_blank">#2 spot</a> of a "top biking cities in the U.S." list. As for hailing a ride, this <i>seems</i> low considering the <a class="p-a" href="http://www.businessofapps.com/data/uber-statistics/#1" target="_blank">meteoric rise</a> of ride-sharing applications, but receiving pure <a class="p-a" href="https://www.citylab.com/transportation/2017/07/private-mobility-services-need-to-share-their-data-heres-how/532482/" target="_blank">data</a> from these companies still remains a pipe-dream to <a class="p-a" href="https://www.wired.com/story/uber-nacto-data-sharing/" target="_blank">most</a>. Until aggregate data is made widely available, we will be unable to fully understand this technology's impact on bus ridership beyond assumptions based on individual or anecdotal observations.</p>

                <h3>Fare Increases</h3>
                <p class='description'>Since 2010, WMATA has increased their bus fares five times to varying degrees. The most recent fare increase of a quarter per trip was the largest percent change since it went from 85&cent; to $1 in 1991. Regarding the most recent increase...</p><p class='description quote'><i>“It’s economics 101,” said Arlington resident Jim Hurysz, who opposed the County Board’s decision last month to raise fares. “Higher fares means fewer riders.”</i></p><p class='description quote'><i>[It] will affect hundreds of thousands of daily commuters, but are particularly troubling for bus riders, many of whom use the bus because it’s cheaper than Metrorail. Some of the region’s low-wage workers, immigrants and elderly residents on fixed incomes depend almost exclusively on the buses to get around.</i></p><p class='description'><b><a class="p-a" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/trafficandcommuting/its-about-to-get-more-expensive-to-ride-the-bus/2017/06/17/ae35a960-4c82-11e7-bc1b-fddbd8359dee_story.html?utm_term=.894cecd30505" target="_blank">Washington Post</a></b> - June 17, 2017</p>

Numbers don't lie. Right now, people prefer other modes of transportation. This begs the question, <i>are buses worth saving?</i></p><p class='description'>Over the past few years we have only scratched the surface of location-based smart phone applications that allow us to request a ride (Uber officially launched in 2011) or hop on a <a class="p-a" href="https://wtop.com/dc/2018/08/dockless-bike-companies-ofo-mobike-pull-out-of-dc-but-others-remain/slide/1/" target="_blank">bike</a> or <a class="p-a" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/dr-gridlock/wp/2018/03/28/bird-scooters-roll-out-in-d-c-and-its-executive-wants-a-pledge-to-save-our-sidewalks/?utm_term=.c57f20c7c4bd" target="_blank">scooter</a> to quickly get us to our destination for nearly the same price as a standard bus.
